Task 1: The Stairway
One Giant wants to climb the Magical Tower stairway. He knows he could step over each K-th stair. An Old Troll is asking the Giant how many stairs will he step in total if there are N stairs in the stairway. Write a program, that will help Giant answer the Old Troll.
The program accepts N and K as *command-line arguments* (not stdin) and returns the total number of stairs the Giant steps to stdout.

Please make this code with 

gcc steps.c -o steps.o -c
