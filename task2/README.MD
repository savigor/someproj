Task 2: The Bridge
The Greedy King wants to collect tribute for each span of the Magical Bridge the merchants pass. He wants to install special wired sensors on each of the spans, with communication cables leading directly to the Treasury Department base station located at one bank of the river. He asked the Mighty Wizard to calculate the total length of the cables. But Mighty Wizard knows that there will be no enough cables in the whole Kingdom and it's better to use wireless solutions. Help him convince the Greedy King.
Write a program that will help the Mighty Wizard to calculate the total length of the cables required. A program accepts two *command-line arguments*, N - the total number of spans the Magical Bridge has, and the second argument D - the distance between the spans (all spans are distributed evenly and the distance from the bank of the river to the first span is also D), and returns the total length of the cables.
