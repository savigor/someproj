Task 3: The Knight
The Binary Knight fights for every bit of free space on his hard drive. His favorite arsenal is a combination of `ls -la` and `rm -rf` tools. Once, during a glorious three-day fight, he has accidentally removed the `ls` tool. Now he does not know which files are there on his disk and how much space they occupy.
Help the Binary Knight get back to glorious disk freedom battles soon. Write a program that produces the same output as `ls -la`.

Note: providing separate support for -l and -a flags is not strictly required but will be appreciated

Please make this code with 

gcc curdirls.c -o curdirls.o -c

gcc -lm curdirls.o -o curdirls

A compiled program can take the arguments -a -l -al (-la)
